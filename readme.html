<h3>Submission details</h3>
<p>
    Name: Avigdor Shatz <br>

<h3>Running the program</h3>
<p>
    To run the program just run the Main class from the prog package.
</p>

<h3>Adding a command</h3>
<p>
    The way I wrote the program makes it very simple to add a command. <br>
    To add a new command just add a new class that implements the command interface, <br>
    then add the following line into the CommandContainer constructor: <br>
    <code>hm.put([command], new [NewCommand]());</code>
</p>

<h3>English Checker Algorithm</h3>
<p>
    The EnglishChecker class implements the first Algorithm suggested in the exercise. <br>
    First, we build the English Frequency Table and the given text Frequency table. <br>
    then, we compare the two tables and if the variance is below a certain threshold, <br>
    then the given text is very likely to be in english.
</p>

<h3>Test Package</h3>
<p>
    I included a test package that enables easy testing.  <br>
    You can ignore it, or use it to test my program. :)
